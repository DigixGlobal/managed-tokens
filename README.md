## ERC-20 Compatible Interface for Cryptocurrency Exchanges

### Introduction

Ethereum is a public blockchain platform with programmable transaction functionality.  It provides a decentralized stack based virtual machine that allows the deployment and execution of business logic through pre-defined state transition rules.  These rules are commonly referred in the Ethereum knowledge domain as "smart contracts", "contracts", or "DApps".  

One of the most basic form of a contract is the token ledger or "meta-currency" that provides a mapping of accounts to balances (a ledger of accounts) and provides rules of accounting (i.e. how balances can be transferred from one account to another) .  

### Purpose

[ERC-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20) is a proposed standard for creating a meta-currency ledger on Ethereum.  The sample code provided allows for crypto-currency exchanges and other services to interface with ERC-20 compatible tokens.
